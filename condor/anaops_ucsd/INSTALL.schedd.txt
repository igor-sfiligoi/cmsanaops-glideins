Install instructions for a glidein-compatible Condor schedd
===========================================================

This document explains how to install a glidein-compatible
submit node to be used by the CMS AnaOps Instance at UCSD
(i.e. the schedd node).
It will work for nodes at UNL as well.

It covers the installation of Condor only.
It does not cover other services, like CRAB.

What we will get
----------------
We will create a full condor install.

We will create symbolic links from
/etc/condor
so we can access all config files from there.

The actual config is split in multiple files, most of them living in
/etc/condor/config.d
Most of the files never need to be changed. So you can 
copy over the (partial) config files from central repositories at any time, 
without loosing anything.
If you want to tweak your Condor config, please do it in
/etc/condor/config.d/99_local_tweaks.config

Assumtions
----------
0) You have extracted the current CVS tree from CVS:
     https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/WorkBookComputingConcepts#Anonymous_CVS_access_pserver
     cvs -d ":pserver:anonymous@cmscvs.cern.ch:/local/reps/CMSSW" co COMP/GLIDEINWMS/condor_config
1) We are installing Condor as root, from the tarballs.
   Download them from, if needed:
   http://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/downloads/
   Use the latest 7.8.X tarball for the schedd, and 7.9.X for condor_history.
   You have already unpacked the tarballs.  
2) The Grid security pieces must be already in place in
   /etc/grid-security
   Get them from either the OSG or gLite installations.
   Having the other standard Grid binaries (e.g. voms-proxy-info)
   in the path is recommended, but not strictly necessary.
3) The system has a dummy account called
   condor
   already configured.
   (no-one should be able to login into it)
4) You have the glideinWMS software available locally.
   Please use the v2_7 or later variant.

5) We will use the following environment variables;
    CMSDIR         - Where is this CVS tree is living
    CONDORTARDIR   - Where you untared the v7.8.X Condor tarball
    CONDORTARDIRv9 - Where you untared the v7.9.X Condor tarball
    GWMSDIR        - Where you extracted the glideinWMS tree
    INSTDIR        - Where the condor installation will live after the installation
   set them to whatever you like, or just plainly replace their content in-line.

Installation steps
------------------
1) Run the installer script
  $CVSDIR/bin/install_condor.sh schedd $INSTDIR $CONDORTARDIR $GWMSDIR anaops_ucsd 
2) Patch condor_history with
  $CVSDIR/crab2_rcondor/cms_schedd_patch.sh $CONDORTARDIRv9 

After the installation
----------------------
Remember to authorize the schedd in the Collector.

You will likely need to install the GRATIA probe.

You are now ready to start Condor
# To start condor, just use
/sbin/service condor start
# You may also want to tell Condor to start on reboot
/sbin/chkconfig condor on

Binary upgrade steps
--------------------
If and when you need to upgrade the Condor binaries,
   use the glideinWMS helper script
  $GWMS/install/glidecondor_upgrade <newtarball>

followed by a new invocation of
  $CVSDIR/crab2_rcondor/cms_schedd_patch.sh $CONDORTARDIRv9 

Config upgrade steps
--------------------
Anytime you need to upgrade the config files from CVS, run
  $CVSDIR/bin/config_condor.sh schedd $GWMSDIR anaops_ucsd
