Installtion instructions
========================

These directory structure provides the needed files
to get a glidein-compatible Condor node up and running.

Since CMS runs a varied set of Condor instances, 
there we provide different instructions for different instances:
* anaops_ucsd/INSTALL.schedd.txt   - AnaOps@UCSD schedd installation
* prod_cern/INSTALL.schedd.txt     - Production@CERN schedd installation
* crab2_rcondor/INSTALL.schedd.txt - CRAB/rcondor schedd installtion
                                     (builds on top of one of the above) 

The other directories provide only partial information
and you probably don't want to start from those.
