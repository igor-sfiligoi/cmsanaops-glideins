Install instructions for a glidein-compatible Condor schedd
===========================================================

This document explains how to install a glidein-compatible
submit node to be used by the CMS AnaOps Instance at CERN
(i.e. the schedd node).

It covers the installation of Condor only.
It does not cover other services, like CRAB.

Steps
--------
1)
Download the installation script
wget https://raw.github.com/igor-sfiligoi/cmsanaops-glideins/deployment/condor/bin/anaops_schedd_install.sh
chmod a+x anaops_schedd_install.sh

2)
Run the script
./anaops_schedd_install.sh -auto

To upgrade
--------
1)
Download the upgrade script
wget https://raw.github.com/igor-sfiligoi/cmsanaops-glideins/deployment/condor/bin/anaops_schedd_update.sh
chmod a+x anaops_schedd_update.sh

2)
Run the script
./anaops_schedd_update.sh -all

What we will get
----------------
We will create a full condor install.

We will create symbolic links from
/etc/condor
so we can access all config files from there.

The actual config is split in multiple files, most of them living in
/etc/condor/config.d
Most of the files never need to be changed. So they can be
copied over the from central repositories at any time,
without loosing anything.
If you want to tweak your Condor config, please do it in
/etc/condor/config.d/99_local_tweaks.config
