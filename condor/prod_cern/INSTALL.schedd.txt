Install instructions for a glidein-compatible Condor schedd
===========================================================

WARNING: This document is obsolete. It likely does not work anymore.


This document explains how to install a glidein-compatible
submit node to be used by the CMS Production Instance at CERN
(i.e. the schedd node).

It covers the installation of Condor only.
It does not cover other services, like WMAgent.

What we will get
----------------
We will create a full condor install under the cmst1 user.

The actual config is split in multiple files, most of them living in
$INSTDIR/condor_local/config
Most of the files never need to be changed. So you can 
copy over the (partial) config files from central repositories at any time, 
without loosing anything.
If you want to tweak your Condor config, please do it in
$INSTDIR/condor_local/99_local_tweaks.config

Assumtions
----------
0) You have extracted the current CVS tree from CVS:
     https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/WorkBookComputingConcepts#Anonymous_CVS_access_pserver
     cvs -d ":pserver:anonymous@cmscvs.cern.ch:/local/reps/CMSSW" co COMP/GLIDEINWMS/condor_config
1) We are installing Condor as user cmst1, from the tarball.
   Download it from, if needed:
   http://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/downloads/
   Use the latest 7.8.X tarball.
   You have already unpacked the tarball.  
2) The Grid CA public keys are avaialble at
    /afs/cern.ch/project/gd/LCG-share/certificates
3) The host certificates are avaialble in
    /data/certs
4) You have the glideinWMS software available locally.
   Please use the v2_7 or later variant.

5) We will use the following environment variables;
    CVSDIR         - Where is this CVS tree is living
    CONDORTARDIR   - Where you untared the Condor tarball
    GWMSDIR        - Where you extracted the glideinWMS tree
    INSTDIR        - Where the condor installation will live after the installation
   set them to whatever you like, or just plainly replace their content in-line.

Installation steps
------------------
1) Run the installer script
  $CVSDIR/bin/install_condor.sh -nolsb schedd $INSTDIR $CONDORTARDIR $GWMSDIR prod_cern cmst1

2) Since cmst1 is a service account, it has no $HOME
   so you will ahve to run 
      source $INSTDIR/condor.sh
   every time you log into it.

After the installation
----------------------
Remember to authorize the schedd in the Collector.

You are now ready to start Condor with
$INSTDIR/etc/init.d/condor start

Binary upgrade steps
--------------------
If and when you need to upgrade the Condor binaries,
   use the glideinWMS helper script
  $GWMS/install/glidecondor_upgrade <newtarball>

Config upgrade steps
--------------------
Anytime you need to upgrade the config files from CVS, run
  $CVSDIR/bin/config_condor.sh schedd $GWMSDIR proc_cern
